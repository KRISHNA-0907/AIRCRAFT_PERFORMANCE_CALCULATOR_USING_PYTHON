A modular and practical Python tool for calculating essential aircraft performance parameters. This script is designed for students, engineers, and aviation enthusiasts to quickly compute key metrics that are critical for flight planning and analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Range & Endurance:** Calculates maximum range (in miles) and endurance (in hours) based on fuel capacity and consumption.
- **Weight & Balance:** Computes the total weight and the crucial Center of Gravity (CG) position from a list of moments.
- **Aerodynamic Forces:** Calculates the Lift and Drag forces acting on an aircraft using standard aerodynamic equations.
- **Flight Mechanics:** Computes aircraft Weight, Acceleration, Velocity, and Distance traveled using Newtonian mechanics.
- **Data Export:** Outputs all results in a neatly formatted display to the console and automatically saves them to a text file (`aircraft_performance_analysis.txt`) for record-keeping.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

### Dependencies

This script uses only the Python Standard Library. No external packages are required.

### Running the Calculator

1.  **Clone the repository or download the script:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aircraft-performance-calculator.git
    cd aircraft-performance-calculator
    ```

2.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python performance_calculator.py
    ```
    The results will be printed to your terminal and simultaneously saved to a file.

3.  **Review the Output:**
    - Check the console for a pretty-printed summary.
    - Find the detailed text file `aircraft_performance_analysis.txt` in the same directory.
